# Journey To Low Code/No Code Application Security


This series will focus on how to easily add authentication to web apps with zero code changes and no redeploy, how to secure a Spring boot Application and lastly how to Ensure that the correct people have the approved access to sensitive data of an application.Â 

You no longer have to worry about setting up infrastructure for identity, ensuring geo-availability, and confirming compliance regulations. Instead, enhance your apps with advanced security capabilities, such as multifactor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO) and user-defined password policies. You can also use App ID's scalable user registry to let users manage their own accounts.
